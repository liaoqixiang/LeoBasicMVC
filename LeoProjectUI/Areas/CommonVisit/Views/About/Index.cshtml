                This is my second Web App which is all about sharing a link.<br /><br />
                The idea is simple. I just want to test my skills on Asp.Net MVC.<br /><br />
                It's not a fancy website(compared with the first one i developed) with a lot of css features or javascript features<br /><br />
                Because i dont want to waste time on front-end design or making website looks pretty.<br /><br />
                The main goal here is to show how i can use ORM EF to interact with MSSQL to achieve CURD and implement Authentication and Authorization by using Asp.net MVC.

            As you can see from my source code, i'm not strictly using 3 tiers architechure to make it.
            <br /><br />
            because this is a small project and i implement it in my first project.
            Also, i can not only use 3 tiers architechure but many tiers architechure is familiar as well. Because i have seen some big project
            and some senior develoers taught me how to build project with different layers to make project extendable.
            <br /><br />
            The Technologies here:<br /><br />
            DataBase: MSSQL(MicroSoft Server SQL)<br /><br />
            ORM: Entity FrameWork(i can do it in Linq but EF is more powerful)<br /><br />
            Frond-end: Jquery(to ajaxifyling my Mvc App), BootStrap<br /><br />
            BackEnd: Asp.net MVC c#.Net
            Special: Log4Net to record the errorss and also direct to a error page.
