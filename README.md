# LeoBasicMVC
Asp.net MVC url station

Brief Intro:
This is my second Web App which is all about sharing a link.
The idea is simple. I just want to test my skills on Asp.Net MVC.
It's not a fancy website(compared with the first one i developed) with a lot of css features or javascript features
Because i dont want to spend time on front-end design or making website looks pretty.
The main goal here is to show how i can use ORM EF to interact with MSSQL to achieve CURD and implement Authentication and Authorization by using Asp.net MVC.


As you can see from my source code, i'm not strictly using 3 tiers architechure to make it.
because this is a small projectã€‚

Also, i can not only use 3 tiers architechure but many tiers architechure is familiar as well. 
Because i have seen some big project and some senior develoers taught me how to build project with different layers to make project extendable.

The Technologies here:
1. DataBase: MSSQL(MicroSoft Server SQL)
2. ORM: Entity FrameWork
3. Frond-end: Jquery(to ajaxifyling my Mvc App), BootStrap, Asp.net MVC 
4. BackEnd:c#.Net
5. Special: Log4Net to record the errorss and also direct to a error page.

Use Admin account
Email:admin@gmail.com   Password:123 
to sign in to see all my features and functionalities.
Or Register to submit Url that you know about
Different roles mean different authority, normal users only can view the Submitted URL or Submit a URL.
Anonymous Users also can submit a Url by clicking casual submit.
